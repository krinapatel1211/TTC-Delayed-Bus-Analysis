TTC Delayed Bus Analysis

The TTC (Toronto Transit Commission) is the public transportation provider in Toronto, Canada, responsible for operating buses, streetcars, and subways throughout the city. As with any transportation system, 
delays can impact the service’s efficiency and passengers’ satisfaction. An analysis report has been prepared and presented to understand better the frequency and causes of delays on TTC buses. 
It provides a comprehensive overview of the uncertainties that occurred during a specific period and the factors contributing to them. It also includes delay prediction for the year 2023.
By identifying the causes of delays, the TTC can develop strategies to minimize them and improve the overall quality of its bus service.
